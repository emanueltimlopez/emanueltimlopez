### Hey! I'm Ema, a product-led Software Engineer

I have been in the software development world for 15 years. I began as a freelance, then joined an agency, working on various projects, including game development. Later on, I transitioned to a large company where I gained experience in scalability, quality, and leadership teams.

Now I work in technical consulting, creating apps, and helping to improve product discovery and delivery for startups.
